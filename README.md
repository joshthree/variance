# Variance
This is my first research independent research project as part of my Master's thesis.  A few years later, with knowledge gained during my PhD studies, I refined the project.  The project is associated with a paper that was published in IEEE International Conference on Blockchain, where it won Best Paper Award.

This is also contains the beginnings of my ZKProver library, which can be used to construct logical compositions of zero knowledge proofs.

This library is the experimental framework model used to create the graphs and comparisons within the Variance paper.
